# Code-Connect

## About
We are a five-member team, completing our final group project together at Dev BootCamp in San Francisco, CA. Soon-to-be-grads entering into Phase 4 ("funemployment" as we like to say), we hope to create a space where other boots can easily connect with companies or employers that are champions of diversity, with a focus on hiring candidates from non-traditional educational backgrounds.
